IMPORTANT: You must have a trusted person drive or accompany you after the procedure. 
Expect to be in clinic for approximately 2.5 - 3 hours after arrival time.


*** Please remember that you should expect your period up to 10-12 days after retrieval.  It's expected for your period to be heavier than normal. Please send your team a portal message with your cycle day 1 for your record and possible next steps.

*** Please note: only one healthy, asymptomatic support person may accompany you on the day of retrieval. They will be able to stay with you in pre-op, and will be called back in to see you once you're awake in the recovery area. 
They will need to wait in our waiting room during the actual procedure.  

Please read the additional guidelines below and call the clinic at 415-353-7475 if you have any urgent questions.

GUIDELINES FOR EMBRYO CRYOPRESERVATION


THE EVENING BEFORE THE EGG RETRIEVAL

- IMPORTANT: DO NOT EAT ANYTHING AFTER MIDNIGHT. Due to a national shortage in IV fluid, anesthesia has asked that you drink water (clear fluid) up to 2 hours prior to your arrival time. Please stop drinking water at 7:00AM.


THE DAY OF THE EGG RETRIEVAL

- Do NOT wear any perfume or anything with a strong scent.

- Do not bring any valuables with you.

- If you take any morning medications by mouth, please bring them on day of the procedure. Anesthesia will evaluate if they can be taken with a small sip of water or if they must be held and taken AFTER the procedure.

- Check in at the front desk at 499 Illinois St, 6th Floor. 

- Wear loose comfortable clothing. If you wear contacts, you will be asked to remove them (please bring your contacts case in with you) or you may choose to wear glasses instead.  


COLLECTION OF THE SEMEN SAMPLE

We recommend that the semen sample be produced in the clinic, unless it is absolutely necessary that you produce it at home.  In which case, you will need to inform your nurse of this and make arrangements to pick up a sterile specimen container.  If collecting at home, the specimen should be received by lab personnel within one hour of production.

It will be important to provide us with a good, clean specimen.  Prior to coming to the clinic, we ask that you shower and wash the genital area thoroughly.  At the time of the collection, you will be given a sterile specimen container.  You should again wash your hands thoroughly and collect the specimen by masturbation ONLY.  

If you anticipate any difficulty with collection, please do not hesitate to discuss this beforehand so the appropriate measures can be taken.  

IMPORTANT:

- You should abstain 2-5 days prior to producing the semen sample for the Egg Retrieval. The easiest way to ensure this is to ejaculate on the day of trigger; and then again as scheduled on the day of the Egg Retrieval. 

- You must bring a photo I.D. to show to lab personnel prior to being roomed to collect the semen sample.


AFTER THE EGG RETRIEVAL

You will feel some drowsiness from the medications given to you before, during and after the procedure. The recovery period can be anywhere from 1-2 hours.  You will be informed about the number of eggs that were retrieved and before you are discharged the Recovery Nurse will give you post procedure instructions.

IMPORTANT: You MUST make arrangements for someone to drive you home after the Egg Retrieval.  It must be your partner, family member, friend or a licensed medical transport service.  You will NOT be allowed to take a taxi or the bus home alone.

*** No strenuous physical activity for 1-2 weeks, as your ovaries are still enlarged at this time and there is a chance of ovarian torsion (twisting of the ovaries) occurring, which would require emergency surgery. However, we do promote LOW IMPACT exercising (i.e. walking, dancing, bicycling, swimming). You may take Motrin, Advil and Aleve for any abdominal cramping / discomfort.

If you notice any unusual bleeding, discomfort, fever or have any questions, do not hesitate to call our office at (415) 353-7475.


THE DAY AFTER THE EGG RETRIEVAL

You will be contacted with your fertilization information. Please check your portal messages for an update. 
You will receive your cryopreservation information on the final day of freeze. If you are doing genetic testing, you will be contacted in 2 - 3 weeks after the biopsy by a Genetic Counselor.

Please note that on the day after your egg retrieval it is normal to feel discomfort, such as bloating and constipation. We recommend starting a stool softener (such as Colace) or increasing your fiber intake (taking Metamucil) tonight, night of trigger, in anticipation of your upcoming egg retrieval.
