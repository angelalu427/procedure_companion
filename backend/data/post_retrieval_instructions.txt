POST-RETRIEVAL INSTRUCTIONS for Patients undergoing Cryopreservation


Following your egg retrieval, you may experience some lower abdominal/pelvic area tenderness and feel tired or sleepy from the medications you have received during the procedure.  Use of a warm heating pad on a low setting may help alleviate some of these symptoms.

You may also have some light vaginal spotting. This bleeding is usually scant and may be red to brown in color.  Vaginal bleeding as heavy as a menstrual period is not normal after retrieval and should be reported.   Please use only a maxi-pad or panty liner, not a tampon for the first 48 hours.  

It is not uncommon to experience some nausea after your retrieval due to the narcotic medications used, although excessive or persistent vomiting is not normal.  The medications used during your egg retrieval may not be eliminated by your body for up to 24 hours. You may feel "hung over" or just not your normal self.   

It is not uncommon to temporarily feel some of the following related to the hormone changes after an egg retrieval: irritable, sad, depressed, tearful, angry, and other changes in your mood.

It is not uncommon to experience constipation after your retrieval. We recommend starting Metamucil or your preferred fiber source. If you have a history of constipation post sedation, we find it helpful to start an over-the-counter stool softener (i.e. docusate sodium or colace) once a day to help soften your stools. If this does not help, please reach out to your care team for further recommendations.

Activity: no significant restrictions as long as there's no trauma to the abdomen or potential for falls (examples: football, soccer, skiing).  We recommend listening to your body and doing a little less than your maximal effort, but no need to abstain from      exercise. If you have any questions about a particular activity, please feel to contact our office


For the next 24-hour period we ask that you do not: 
1) Drive a car or operate machinery or power tools.  
2) Drink any alcoholic beverages.  
3)  Make any important decisions.

- You may eat whatever you like after the egg retrieval procedure, as long as you are not feeling nauseated.  If you experience nausea, limit yourself to clear liquids and crackers until the nausea subsides.  It is usually best to avoid spicy or heavy foods that are difficult to digest for at least 24 hours.  

- Antibiotic therapy will be administered prior to your retrieval to minimize the risk of infection following this procedure. 

- For pain/discomfort after today's procedure:  You may take Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) 400 mg every 4 hours OR 600mg every 6hours (Max 1200 mg in 24 hours) In addition to Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 500-650 mg orally (two regular Tylenol/acetaminophen or one extra-strength) every 4 hours as needed for abdominal cramping or discomfort OR 1,000 mg every 6 hours. (Max 4000 mg in 24 hours).
