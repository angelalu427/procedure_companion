Guidelines for Ovarian Hyperstimulation

Part of the process of In Vitro Fertilization involves stimulating the ovaries with Gonadotropins to induce the production of multiple eggs.  This is what is referred to as "controlled ovarian hyperstimulation."  During this process, some patients may experience significant enlargement of the ovaries while producing multiple eggs.  Generally this process is tolerated very well with patients commonly experiencing a sensation of abdominal fullness and bloating.

Signs & Symptoms:

- Mild:	Abdominal bloating & fullness sensation
Nausea
Diarrhea
Slight weight gain

- Moderate: Weight gain >2 pounds in 24 hours
Increase in abdominal girth causing clothes to feel tight
Vomiting & Diarrhea
Dark, concentrated urine in less amounts
Dryness of skin and hair
Thirst

- Severe: Marked abdominal fullness/bloating or distension
Shortness of breath
Urination has reduced or stopped and become more concentrated
Chest or calf pains
Lower abdominal pain

Causes:
- Ovaries are larger than normal, tender and fragile
- High E2 (estradiol) and progesterone levels in your bloodstream may upset your digestive system and fluid balance, causing bloating
- Fluid imbalance may cause dehydration and accumulation of fluids in the abdomen, lungs, or other tissue
- Risk for abnormal blood clotting increases

Recommendations:
- Weigh yourself daily and keep track of your weight.  If your weight increases over 3 pounds in one day, or a total of 10 pounds or greater, please call us
- Drink plenty of clear liquids (6-8  8-ounce glasses daily) to maintain proper fluid balance
- Pay attention to the amount of urine that you are producing, the frequency of urination, and the concentration of your urine (how dark it is).  If indicated we can provide you with a container (called a toilet hat) to measure exactly the amount of produced.
- Abstain from intercourse or physical activity that could increase pressure on the fragile ovaries.
